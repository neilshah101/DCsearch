#### Example:  

This was a 1 week long project built during my 14 week in DigitalCraft Web Development bootcamp. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the Google API based on what they were Search , such as 'walmart', 'john Doe', 'starbucks in Austin texas', etc. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` and `npm init` for node.js, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux`.
